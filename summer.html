  <h1>What I did for summer</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello my name is VJ.  <i>I am from the Philippines but live in Bangkok, Thailand.</i></p>

  <h2 id="specialHeader">Why I think summer is important</h2>
  
  <p>I think that summer is important because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>allows you to go to the beach</li>
    <li>You get a break form school</li>
    <li>Allows plants and animals to recover</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I did</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay at home</li>
    <li>Study html</li>
    <li>I went to the beach at a certain place in Thailand</li>
  </ul>

<h2>What did I do at this certain beach in Thailand</h2>

  
  <p>On the first day I went swimming, walking by the beach and went kayaking with my cousins. During the vening we had our free welcome drinks, I ordered the coconut mocktail. I also tried a few drinks like the one called pink dolphin</p>
  <br>
<p>On the second day I woke up early at 7 a.m., I went to go walking with my family by the beach, they took some pictures. Later, at 10 a.m. I went on this small sailing boat. The boat was a bit fun but got boring when there was no wind to puch the boat. I had breakfast at the resort and we left at 12:30 p.m.</p>
